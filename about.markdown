## Mission Statement

The **Westwood SolidWorks User Group** (Westwood SWUG) is a UCLA student-run, student-oriented official [SolidWorks User Group](https://www.swugn.org/). Our mission is to communicate information about everything related to SolidWorks to UCLA students, including information about student licenses, the SolidWorks Certification Program, career opportunities, User Group Network events, etc. By exposing students to these numerous resources, we promote further development into design and engineering. We also work closely with UCLA student organizations and UCLA engineering departments to provide a centralized location for CAD education.

We provide both an online, asynchronus [curriculum](/certifications/) and live workshops which prepare students for the [Certified SolidWorks Associate](https://www.SolidWorks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswa-mechanical-design) (CSWA) exam. After proving competency by passing the official practice exam, students will be able to request vouchers to take the CSWA at no cost.

We also offer [Certified SolidWorks Professional](https://www.solidworks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswp-mechanical-design) (CSWP) vouchers contingent on a passing score in the CSWP practice test, but currently do not provide training materials. Students seeking CSWP certification can take advantage of the material on [MySolidWorks](https://my.solidworks.com/training/path/17/cswp-exam-prep-course) and/or resources available on YouTube and the general internet.
